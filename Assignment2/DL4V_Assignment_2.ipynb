You can try to start with the simple network we defined above for the MNSIT dataset(with some modification for dealing with different sized colored images unlike MNIST). But to achive the SoTA performance you need to do a lot of hackery. These are list of few things, we would encourage you to try: \n","\n","- Use data augmentation wisely. Read and understand how to perform the augmentations listed below. \n","    * RandomFlips, Color Jittering\n","    * Cutout, Cutmix\n","    * Mixup\n","    * Auto-augment\n","\n","- Try to increase the image size using standard image interpolation techniques. Try using tricks like Progressive resizing of images and see if it helps. \n","\n","- After certain number of layers, adding more layer might not be of much help, run experiments on SVHN and see if you observe this. \n","\n","- To understand the difficulties in training deeper networks read this paper: [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)\n","\n","- To improve the performance on SVHN, try using architectures like [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), [DesnseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) or [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946).
